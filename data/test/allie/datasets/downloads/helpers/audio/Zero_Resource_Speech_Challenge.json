{"Zero Resource Speech Challenge": {"description": "- The ultimate goal of the Zero Resource Speech Challenge is to construct a system that learns an end-to-end Spoken Dialog (SD) system, in an unknown language, from scratch, using only information available to a language learning infant. \u201cZero resource\u201d refers to zero linguistic expertise (e.g., orthographic/linguistic transcriptions), not zero information besides audio (visual, limited human feedback, etc). The fact that 4-year-olds spontaneously learn a language without supervision from language experts show that this goal is theoretically reachable.", "link": "https://github.com/bootphon/zerospeech2017"}}
