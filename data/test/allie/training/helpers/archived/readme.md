## Archived modeling techniques 

I tried a wide range of autoML libraries. These did not make the cut for these reasons. 

* '[autobazaar](https://github.com/HDI-Project/AutoBazaar)' - AutoBazaar: An AutoML System from the Machine Learning Bazaar (from the Data to AI Lab at MIT).&#x2611; - this was a bit hard to extract a machine learning model from and the schema was a little hard to make interoperable with Allie; may get to this later if the framework is further supported. ðŸ‘Ž 
* '[autokeras](https://autokeras.com/)' - automatic optimization of a neural network using neural architecture search (takes a very long time) - consistently has problems associated with saving and loading models in keras. ðŸ‘Ž 
* '[autosklearn](https://github.com/automl/auto-sklearn)' - added to pip3 installation + script. (segmentation faults are common, thus archived. If documentation and community improves, may be good to add back in). ðŸ‘Ž 
* '[pLDA](https://github.com/RaviSoji/plda)' - this works only for symmetrical images (as it cannot compute eigenvector for many of the feature arrays we have created). For this reason, it is probably not a good idea to use this as a standard training method. ðŸ‘Ž 

Note that as the documentation and support for these libraries becomes better over time, it may make sense to move them into production.

They just don't work now :-) 

## Other (nice-to-have) things to incorporate

* [recursive feature elimination]() - can help select appropriate features / show feature importances (sc_ script) - use Yellowbrick for this.
* add in [featuretools](https://github.com/Featuretools/featuretools) to create higher-order features to get better accuracy.
* hyperparameter optimization - https://github.com/autonomio/talos
* Clustering algorithms
