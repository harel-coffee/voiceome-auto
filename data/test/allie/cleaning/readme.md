# Cleaning

![](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/annotation/helpers/assets/clean.png)

This part of Allie's skills relates to data cleaning.

Data cleansing is the process of making clean datasets - like removing noise in audio files. It allows for data with a higher signal-to-noise ratio for modeling, increasing robustness of models.

## How to use cleaning scripts

To clean an entire folder of a certain file type (e.g. audio files of .WAV format), you can run:

```python3
cd /Users/jim/desktop/allie
cd cleaning/audio_cleaning
python3 clean.py /Users/jim/desktop/allie/train_dir/males/
python3 clean.py /Users/jim/desktop/allie/train_dir/females/
```

The code above will featurize all the audio files in the folderpath via the default_cleaner specified in the settings.json file (e.g. 'clean_mono16hz'). 

## Extending to other file types

Note you can extend this to any of the file types. The table below overviews how you could call each as a augmenter. In the code below, you must be in the proper folder (e.g. ./allie/augmentation/audio_augmentations for audio files, ./allie/augmentation/image_augmentation for image files, etc.) for the scripts to work properly.

| Data type | Supported formats | Call to featurizer a folder | Current directory must be | 
| --------- |  --------- |  --------- | --------- | 
| audio files | .MP3 / .WAV | ```python3 clean.py [folderpath]``` | ./allie/cleaning/audio_cleaning | 
| text files | .TXT | ```python3 clean.py [folderpath]``` | ./allie/cleaning/text_cleaning| 
| image files | .PNG | ```python3 clean.py [folderpath]``` | ./allie/cleaning/image_cleaning | 
| video files | .MP4 | ```python3 clean.py [folderpath]``` |./allie/cleaning/video_cleaning| 
| csv files | .CSV | ```python3 clean.py [folderpath]``` | ./allie/cleaning/csv_cleaning | 

## Implemented

### Implemented for all file types

* [clean_opus](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/cleaning/audio_cleaning/clean_opus.py) - converts an audio file to .OPUS audio file format then back to wav (a lossy conversion) - narrowing in more on voice signals over noise signals.
* [clean_randomsplice](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/cleaning/audio_cleaning/clean_randomsplice.py) - take a random splice (time specified in the script) from the audio file.
* [clean_removenoise](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/cleaning/audio_cleaning/clean_removenoise.py) - removes noise from the audio file using SoX program and noise floors.
* [clean_removesilence](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/cleaning/audio_cleaning/clean_removesilence.py) - removes silence from an audio file using voice activity detectors.
* [clean_rename](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/cleaning/audio_cleaning/clean_rename.py) - renames all the audio files in the current directory with a new UUID
* [clean_utterances](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/cleaning/audio_cleaning/clean_utterances.py) - converts all audio files into unique utterances (1 .WAV file --> many .WAV file utterances) for futher analysis.
