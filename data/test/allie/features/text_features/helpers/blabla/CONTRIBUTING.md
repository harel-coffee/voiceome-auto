# Community Contributions to BlaBla

We would be very happy to accept contributions to BlaBla! You can contribute in various ways including by fixing bugs or/and implementing enhancements. If you encounter a bug and want to just raise it without implementing a fix for it, please create an issue on [our issues page](https://github.com/novoic/blabla/issues). However, if you plan to contribute a fix for a bug or implement an enhancement, please read the following.

## Bugfixes

For bugfixes, please follow these steps:

- First, please make sure the bugfix is already not reported. You can do this by both navigating through through existing [issues](https://github.com/novoic/blabla/issues) (including closed ones) and also looking at the [pull requests](https://github.com/novoic/blabla/pulls).
- Please confirm the bug with Novoic by first creating a bug-report issue on our [issues](https://github.com/novoic/blabla/issues) page. In the issue, please include all the details possible so we can reproduce the bug. This includes the platform and environment that you are running with, sample code that we can use to reproduce the bug and any details and dependencies that we should be aware of.
- Once Novoic confirms the bug, you may go ahead and implement the fix for the bug. You may follow up by creating a pull request **against the `dev` branch**. Please note that we do not accept fixes against the `master` branch.

## Enhancements

For implementing any enhancement to the existing codebase, please follow these steps:

- First, please make sure an enhancement of similar nature to what you are recommending does not already exist. You can do this by both navigating through through existing [issues](https://github.com/novoic/blabla/issues) (including closed ones).
- Create a feature-request issue and discuss with Novoic about the enhancement you plan to implement. Novoic will then make sure that the enhancement you plan to implement won't break any existing functionality or create any major new issues.
- Once Novoic confirms the new enhancement, you may proceed by implementing the feature, followed by creating a new pull request **against the `dev` branch**. Please note that we do not accept enhancements against the `master` branch.
