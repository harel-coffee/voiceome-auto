## How to use
```
cd allie/features/text_features
python3 featurize.py [folder] [featuretype]
```

### Text
* [bert features](https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers) - extract BERT-related features from sentences (note shorter sentences run faster here, and long text can lead to long featurization times).
* [fast_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/fast_features.py) - features extracted using the [FastText model](https://fasttext.cc/).
* [glove_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/glove_features.py) - features extracted using the [GloVe model](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/).
* [grammar_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/grammar_features.py) - 85k+ grammar features (memory intensive)
* [nltk_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/nltk_features.py) - standard text feature array (default).
* [spacy_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/spacy_features.py) - feature extracted with the [SpaCy library](https://spacy.io/).
* [textacy_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/textacy_features.py) - a variety of document classification and topic modeling features.
* [text_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/text_features.py) - many different types of features like emotional word counts, total word counts, Honore's statistic and others.
* [w2v_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/allie/blob/master/features/text_features/w2vec_features.py) - note this is the largest model from Google and may crash your computer if you don't have enough memory. I'd recommend fast_features if you're looking for a pre-trained embedding.

### Settings

Here are some default settings relevant to this section of Allie's API:

| setting | description | default setting | all options | 
|------|------|------|------| 
| [default_text_features](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voice_modeling/tree/master/features/csv_features) | default set of text features used for featurization (list). | ["nltk_features"] | ["bert_features", "fast_features", "glove_features", "grammar_features", "nltk_features", "spacy_features", "text_features", "w2v_features"] | 
| default_text_transcriber | the default transcription techniques used to parse raw .TXT files during model training| ["raw_text"] | ["raw_text"]  | 
| transcribe_text | a setting to define whether or not to transcribe text files during featurization and model training via the default_image_transcriber | True | True, False |
