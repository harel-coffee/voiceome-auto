# voiceome
The [Voiceome Study](https://www.voiceome.org/) is the worldâ€™s largest clinical study to collect voice information labeled with health traits. The goal is to recruit between 10,000-100,000 patients into the study and track them at multiple time points to advance scientific understanding for vocal biomarkers and speed up the process for its commercialization.

More information about the Voiceome study can be found @ [the wiki](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/wiki) and [website](https://voiceome.org).

## background/goals
One of the primary causes of slow translation of voice biomarker research is a result of small datasets. There have been many research studies that have shown that acoustic or linguistic voice features relate to health conditions like stress, schizophrenia, depression, bipolar disorder, stroke, and cardiovascular diseases. However, many of these studies have relatively small sample sizes (N<1,000 patients in each class), suffer from poor audio quality (e.g. use of different microphones and data collection techniques), and are difficult to access (e.g. large licensing fees to corporations and/or difficulty obtaining IRB access without close academic ties). These factors dramatically limit the ability to model the underlying data and correlate voice data to health traits, replicate peer-reviewed publications, as well as open up this work to the broader scientific community.

![](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/blob/main/assets/images/thumbnails/confounds.png?raw=true)

Therefore, the main goals of the Voiceome Study include:

- **Standardizing collection tools and features** - Standardize the tools and techniques used to collect and featurize voice samples for use in health-related research. <em> We have done this by building [SurveyLex](https://surveylex.com), a web-enabled survey tool for vocal biomarker research.</em>
- **Establishing reference ranges** - Create a standard set of normative ranges of [acoustic](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/tree/main/assets/references/A/acoustics) and [linguistic](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/tree/main/assets/references/A/linguistics) features across various ages, genders, microphone types, and dialects labeled with health information. <em>These are provided as [tables](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/tree/main/assets/references/A/acoustics) and scripts in this repository</em>.
- **Standardizing voice protocols** - Standardize the series of voice tasks used to collect speech samples for use in the voiceome. <em>These voice protocols can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/wiki), and includes novel tasks like automated confrontational naming tasks and nonword tasks.</em>
- **Standardizing health trait labels** - Standardize the type of health trait labels tied to voice information to emit the most signal from the voice. <em>These are provided [here](https://github.com/jim-schwoebel/voiceome/wiki/16.-Health-labels#lichert-questions-custom-made).</em>
- **Creating machine learning models** - From Voiceome Study dataset, build and optimize novel machine learning models; to publish this work in academic journals openly. <em>These models will be published on in follow-on publications into the future.</em>
- **Creating an ethics framework** - Create a venue for legal, ethical, and security considerations for collecting voice data for health-related purposes. <em>This can be read in the [Voiceome strategic plan](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Dme9tUq0eCepja_7Yg9sNqn_JWKaJxJm/view).</em>
- **Build a lasting community** - The Voiceome project will foster a lasting community and enthusiasm for the field of vocal biomarkers in general. <em>We do this through writing textbooks like [Voice Computing in Python](https://neurolex.ai/voicebook), collaborating with research organizations like the University of Washington and Biogen, and through training fellows through the [Innovation Fellows Program](http://neurolex.ai/research).</em>

## Clinical trial design
Anyone >18 years of age that could speak English was eligible to participate in the Voiceome Study (>6,000 participants completed the first survey). Each participant was randomly assigned one of three tracks (AAAA, ABAB, ABCD, or ACBD) and could participate in follow-on surveys separated by roughly three weeks in these tracks. Subjects were primarily recruited on Amazon Mechanical Turk with a paid incentive ($5-20/session), and anyone who completed 4 surveys was eligible to receive a health report.
